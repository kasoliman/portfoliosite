            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
            <p>There’s much opportunity within the cloud storage market and that was our client’s initial spark to develop a new cloud storage
              web app, but with such a competitive cloud storage market, we were approached to design the full product and make sure that it had
              the right set of features to enable it to compete and shine alongside this particular market’s big-names.<br><br>
              A small design composed of a lead designer and myself were entrusted with the full design elements of this new web app.
              I was responsible for making most of the design decisions and producing the needed deliverables. With this being a completely new product,
              everything that the product needed from research, testing, to design was fully developed by myself from start to finish.</p>

            <p>Our client sought our particular set of experience and skills to create a unique product to redefine the cloud storage experience, provide solid collaborative tools, and communicate to the users a solid brand that appeals to their style. The to-be-designed cloud storage product had to have - on the base level - the same set of tools that were predominant in the market and expected from a cloud storage product, in addition to providing features that would uniquely position the client’s new solution.</p>

          <p>From the start, the client’s understanding of the market, including our very own set of expected beliefs for the product, were all assumptions that haven’t been tested yet with the market. At that stage, I set out to research and understand the needs/wants of cloud storage users.</p>
          <p>I conducted a user survey on Cloud Storage and Organization solutions. The survey aimed at investigating and understanding what features do users actually need and want, when using these solutions/products.</p>
          <p>The survey was completed with a total of 17 respondents, sourced from different parts of the world (North/South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East). Survey’s pool of respondents was predominantly aged between 26 to 30 years old, with the majority (more than 87%) as continued users of cloud storage solutions and spend their time daily using them (more than 70% are daily users). This was indicative of the survey’s strength in understanding which features are important to have in a cloud storage product, as it was driven by a representative pool of active users of these products. </p>

          <h3>USABILITY TESTING</h3>
          <p>The first usability test was conducted using clickable prototypes of the wireframes I designed. As these were lofi mockups, the objective here was to test the foundational flow of the product before taking any steps forward.  I wanted to identify any challenges or frustrations that a user would experience while navigating the product. Anything that would feel out of the ordinary for them. Not just looking for the errors within the design, I also wanted to pinpoint the good stuff, so I can leverage on these elements. Three task scenarios were given to each user.</p>

          <p>Based on the first round of usability testing, several issues were found and the initial wireframing I built for the product required a few good alterations.

        <!-- <div class="pinpointed-text section-box col-lg-6"> -->
          <p>Having pinpointed the faults within the wireframes of the product, I took steps to go back and do further iterations to solve for these user challenges.</p>
          <p>I also kept a good note on what worked well with the prototypes. The positive remarks I received on some of the wireframe’s sections served as reference points, identifying the user behaviors I needed to pay attention to.</p>

When the user first steps foot to the web app’s landing page, the user should be communicated to in a few words, selected to deliver the right message, and should be catchy/trendy (catching the attention of first visitors).</p>

            <h3>A BRAND THAT SPEAKS VALUE</h3>
            <div class="paragraph-description">
              <p>The wireframes didn’t require pay much attention to the product’s branding style, but producing any hifi mockups and prototypes required a style guide.</p>
              <p>To deliver a product, several days were spent to craft the right “look” and “feel” for the product’s logo. This included various iterations done on Adobe Illustrator.</p>
              <p>With a vision in mind, I had already drawn on some ideas on the  “look” and “feel” of the web app, and I wanted these emotions to be expressed through the product’s name.</p>
              <p>Combining the efforts on the mindmapping themes and brainstormed names based on the product’s intended brand value, I sketched out on paper some preliminary logo sketches. The idea here was to do a top-down process to discovering what I wanted from the logo. By starting out with some basic concept sketches, that originated from the overall mental image I wanted to draw for the user, I had come to seven main ideas.</p>
              <p>From the seven concept sketches, I did numerous iterations using Adobe Illustrator. Although my main ideas come first from paper sketches, for purpose of rapid iteration and creative flexibility I always use Adobe Illustrator to really draw out all the possible iterations that come to my mind - it’s where the magic happens.</p>
              <p>Looking back at the user research and competitive analysis, I was able to further refine the branding guidelines I wanted to express for this product. Having understood that this web app’s target market is for working individuals, I wanted the “look” and “feel” of this product to be polished and professional. However, I also wanted to add an attractiveness appeal to the product, to encourage repeat visits by users.</p>

The style guide also outlined the brand’s logo and its variations, guideline on a list of “to-do” and what “not-to-do” when it came to using the logo. It defined the typography, its hierarchy, the type of photography to be used, and what every visual element should aim to communicate on the product.</p>

              <p>There were a total of three rounds of user tests for this product. With every test, I had found that several of my assumptions were challenged as a lot of my understanding on what best suited the user was in the wrong direction. It was imperative that I repeated these user tests at each stage and iteration of the mockup to ensure that these false assumptions were cleared from the final product. From the choice of typography, to the background color and icon size and choice, all these UX/UI elements were tested, and tested some more.</p>

The CTA buttons made sense, most users knew how to find their way around the screens, they knew what each button did, and the “look” and “feel” (aesthetics) were greatly appreciated. Still there were room for further improvement as pointed out by some of the users.</p>

            <p>The challenge with this product was building a solution with all the features that’s considered best-practice in the cloud storage space, thus ensuring it’s on par with key competitors, however also designing to have an app with its very own “character” and unique user experience.</p>
            <p>With cloud storage solutions, most of the products in the market focus a great deal on how solid their network structure is, voicing over the safety of user’s files. Here, I have designed a product that goes one step ahead of what’s by now considered default features of a cloud storage app, by instead focusing on redesigning the experience of a mundane service like cloud storage.</p>
            <p>The real objective here wasn’t to reinvent the infrastructure of cloud storage, but to redefine what cloud storage represented to the user, the overall experience. It was how to make a mundane solution like cloud storage into something that’s “fun”, as the client had requested.</p>

          <div class="column-two col-lg-6">
            <p>What surprised me the most is how many of the assumptions that the client had delivered about users of these type of products were challenged during the user research stage of the project. There is a lot of misunderstanding that took place with the first designed wireframe, and if it weren’t for numerous usability tests, many of these assumptions would have carried over.</p>
            <p>Also, I believe there is room for a lot more improvement but with the project’s deadline to completion, the scope for research was capped. If I had a bigger bandwidth on this project’s timeline, a lot more insight on user behavior by segment could have been revealed, which could lead to some great enhancements to the UX design of cloud storage. This is a big sphere and there’s a lot of opportunity here!</p>
